When embedding Pure Comments, you can keep setup minimal and let `embed.js` infer values automatically, or you can override behaviour with data attributes.

## Quick Start (No Overrides)

If you do this:

```html
<div id="comments"></div>
<script src="https://comments.example.com/public/embed.js" defer></script>
```

Then `embed.js` will:
- infer the post slug from the current page URL
- infer the API base URL from the script `src`

For many sites, that default behaviour is all you need.

## data-post-slug (Optional)

You can use `data-post-slug` on the `#comments` container when you want to explicitly control the post/thread identifier.

```html
<div id="comments" data-post-slug="my-first-post"></div>
<script src="https://comments.example.com/public/embed.js" defer></script>
```

### When to use it

- Your article URL might change over time (slug updates, permalink changes, route migrations).
- You want multiple URLs to point to the same comment thread.
- You use query-string or hash-based routing and want stable thread IDs.

### Why it matters

Different slugs create different threads. If your blog's URL structure changes later, explicit slugs help prevent comment history from splitting across multiple threads.

## data-base-url (Optional)

You can also use `data-base-url` on the script tag when API calls should go to a different origin than the script file.

```html
<script src="https://comments.cdn.example.com/public/embed.js" data-base-url="https://comments.example.com" defer></script>
```

### When to use it

- You host `embed.js` on a CDN, but your API lives on your comments domain.
- Static assets and API are intentionally split across domains.
- You want to force a specific API origin for testing or staged environments.

## Using Both Together

You can combine both overrides:

```html
<div id="comments" data-post-slug="my-first-post"></div>
<script src="https://comments.cdn.example.com/public/embed.js" data-base-url="https://comments.example.com" defer></script>
```

This gives you:
- stable thread mapping (`data-post-slug`)
- explicit API target (`data-base-url`)

## Practical Recommendation

Start with defaults first then add these attributes only when you need predictability across URL changes, multi-domain deployments, or custom routing.
